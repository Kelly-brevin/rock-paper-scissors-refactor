# rock-paper-scissors-refactor

This is a refactor of the Rock paper Scissors game that I built. This refactored version makes use of javascript objects, closure and methods to ensure that the code does not repeat itself, thus adhering to the DRY principle. This refactor is focused only on the javascipt logic. The logic for the UI is in the original rep0 where I learn how to add animations and sound effects to make the game more engaging.
